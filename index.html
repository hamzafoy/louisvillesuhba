            About Us
        </h1>

        <p>
            The Louisville Suhba is a group of young men, around the ages of 18 & older,
            who intentionally wish to improve themselves wholly. In the Islamic tradition,
            there is no separation of "faith" from the "secular" and this means to our young
            men that we should strive to attain excellence in our ritual worship, our personal
            character, in our personal finances, in our career or trades, in our participation
            in the community, and in our chivalry in how we look out for others.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Our group has an ameer, but work together to ensure that our activities are beneficial
            and that all of our members are engaged and participating. Currently, our group has
            decided to attend a declared gathering every week throughout the month. Our activities
            vary between the social & recreational (such as soccer, basketball, or going out to a
            venue), gathering to discuss Islamically themed topics or learning a skill or personally
            beneficial knowledge, and gathering with Imam Wasif Iqbal or any other local scholar
            to understand more complex topics in our religion.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            You can read our calendar, which is updated each month, below.
